    <h2>About Me: Biography</h2>
    <p> I am a Computer Science + Emerging Media Major. I am interested in Web dev, and would like to 
        create simple web games. Puzzle games like Wordle fascinate me, as im suprised by how a simple
        concept can be so fun and liked by many. I have some experience with Web Dev but nothing major,
        just some simple sites from courses I taken. I am from Brooklyn and enjoy playing video games in my free time, as well as some reading ocassionally. 
        I'm the oldest child, with only one younger sibling.

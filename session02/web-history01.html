            <h3>EARLY 20C, Mundaneum, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
            <p>The Mundaneum was an institution which aimed to gather together all the world's knowledge and classify it according to a system called the Universal Decimal Classification. It was developed at the turn of the 20th century by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine. The Mundaneum has been identified as a milestone in the history of data collection and management, and (somewhat more tenuously) as a precursor to the Internet...</p>

            <h3>1945, Memex, Vanneshar Bush</h3>
            <p>The Memex was a conceptual system created by Vannevar Bush for storing data and retrieving it in an easy and organized manner. The system was to provide easy access to the large amount of knowledge that was already recorded. Building on the technology of his time, Bush described a new kind of device which was a sort of mechanized file and library system. He called it a “memex.” The word memex came from combining portions of the words (mem)ory and (ex)tender.The system was never actually built but served as a guide for creating the internet</p>

            <h3>1960s,Project Xanadu "hypertext", Ted Nelson</h3>
            <p>Conceived in 1960 by Ted Nelson, a sociologist turned computer philosopher, Xanadu aimed to revolutionize how humans interact with information. Unlike the World Wide Web that eventually dominated, which Tim Berners-Lee launched in 1989, Nelson’s system envisioned a global hypertext network where documents were fluid, interconnected, and perpetually versioned, allowing users to quote, link, and remix content without breaking connections or infringing copyrights.

            At its core, Xanadu proposed bidirectional links—meaning if Document A linked to Document B, the connection would be visible and navigable from both ends.</p>

            <h3>1971, First Email, Ray Tomlinson</h3>
            <p>Email began as an experiment to see if two computers could exchange a message. The concept of sending another person a message through a computer was not invented by Tomlinson because computer scientists had been exchanging messages on machines for years. Yet these previous forms of electronic communication only allowed people to send messages to other users of the same computer or to numbered mailboxes where the messages had to be printed out.
 
            Tomlinson wanted to send messages to people, not mailboxes, so he decided to modify and combine the programmes that were already out there. The innovative email software he created was called “SNDMSG”.</p>

            <h3>1983, Transfer Control Protocol/ Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), Ray Tomlinson</h3>
            <p>In 1983, the creation and implementation of the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP) marked the official birth of the Internet as we know it today. TCP/IP, developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, provided a robust and scalable framework for data communication across interconnected networks. This protocol suite enabled disparate computer networks to communicate with each other, laying the foundation for the global Internet. For amateur radio operators, the adoption of TCP/IP opened new possibilities for digital communication, including packet radio and Internet-linked repeater systems like EchoLink and IRLP. This pivotal development in networking technology revolutionized global communication, fostering unprecedented connectivity and collaboration.

            <h3>1990, Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
            <p>In 1989, Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (see the original proposal). He coined the term "World Wide Web," wrote the first World Wide Web server, "httpd," and the first client program (a browser and editor), "WorldWideWeb," in October 1990.

            He wrote the first version of the "HyperText Markup Language" (HTML), the document formatting language with the capability for hypertext links that became the primary publishing format for the Web. His initial specifications for URIs, HTTP, and HTML were refined and discussed in larger circles as Web technology spread.</p>

            <p>The first Internet search engine, Archie, is launched. It was used to index FTP archives to make finding files easier. However, as the technology for the World Wide Web was not invented until later in the year, it was not the first web search engine.</p>

            <h3>1991, First Website, Tim-Berner-Lee</h3>
            <p>On August 6, 1991, the first website was introduced to the world.

            And while perhaps not as exciting or immersive as some of the nearly 1.9 billion websites that exist today, it makes sense that the first web page launched on the good ol' W3 was, well, instructions about how to use it.

            The first website contained information about the World Wide Web Project. It launched at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, CERN, where it was created by British computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee. On it, people could find out how to create web pages and learn about hypertext (coded words or phrases that link to content).</p>

            <h3>1992,The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee </h3>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee uploaded a photo of parody doo-wop group Les Horrible Cernettes on 18th July 1992 – the first image to be shared online.

            The photograph was taken at the CERN Hardronic Festival by Silvano de Gennaro, an analyst in the Computer Science department. The girlband were striking a pose for their forthcoming CD cover, little realising their comedy love songs about colliders, quarks, liquid nitrogen, microwaves, and antimatter would soon go down in internet history.</p>

            <h3>1997,The invention of Wi-Fi  IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard  </h3>
            <p>In 1989 in Australia, a team of scientists began working on wireless LAN technology.[14] A prototype test bed for a wireless local area network (WLAN) was developed in 1992 by a team of researchers from the Radiophysics Division of the CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation) in Australia, led by John O'Sullivan.[15] A patent for Wi Fi was lodged by the CSIRO in 1992.[16]

            The first version of the 802.11 protocol was released in 1997, and provided up to 2 Mbit/s link speeds. This was updated in 1999 with 802.11b to permit 11 Mbit/s link speeds.

            In 1999, the Wi-Fi Alliance formed as a trade association to hold the Wi-Fi trademark under which most IEEE 802.11 products are sold.[17]</p>

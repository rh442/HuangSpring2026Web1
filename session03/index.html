    <h2>About Me: Biography</h2>
    <p> I am a Computer Science + Emerging Media Major. I am interested in Web dev, and would like to 
        create simple web games. Puzzle games like Wordle fascinate me, as im suprised by how a simple
        concept can be so fun and liked by many. I have some experience with Web Dev but nothing major,
        just some simple sites from courses I taken. I am from Brooklyn and enjoy playing video games in my free time, as well as some reading ocassionally. 
        I'm the oldest child, with only one younger sibling.

    <h2>History of the Web</h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web ("WWW", "W3" or simply "the Web") is a global information medium that users can access via computers connected to the Internet. The term is often used as a synonym for the Internet, but the Web is a service that operates over the Internet, just as email and videoconferencing do. The history of the Internet and the history of hypertext date back significantly further than that of the World Wide Web
